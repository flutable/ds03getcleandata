#Quick start
## How to run the analysis
1. To run the analysis, set the working folder as follows:

		setwd("C:\\Users\\nick\\Documents\\Coursera\\DS03 Getting & cleaning data\\DS03GetCleanDataGit")
2. Then,

		source("run_analysis.R")

3. If the "root" or uppermost folder is different on your computer, change the working folder AND the value of the *fldProjectroot* variable in the *run_analysis.R* file.

## How to read the tidy data
See the "optional code" section at the bottom of the *run_analysis.R* file.

#Source/original/Raw data
The original folder hierarchy is listed below, along with the variables used to hold folder names in the *run_analysis.R* file.

										Folder variables
		DS03getcleandataGit				fldProjectroot
 			UCI HAR Dataset				fldDataroot
    			test					fldTestdata
	       			Inertial signals
    			train					fldTraindata
	       			Inertial signals
	   
 
##Original data 
The original data were provided as follows (from original dataset)

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

#Processing
As per the original dataset README.txt, the dataset was originally partitioned into training and test data, so there is no procedural reason against merging the data. The data were processed as follows:

1. Read test x/y, training x/y, and subject test/train files
2. Convert test x/y activity codes into meaningful activity names, eg '1' changed to 'walking', '2' to 'walkingupstairs', etc
3. Add the test/train activity names and test/train subject ID columns to the test and training data respectively
4. Append the test data to the training date, thereby merging the datasets
5. Reading the feature names and performing text processing to clean up the feature names as follows:
* removing the characters - ( ) "   , . and adding the meaningful column names "Activity" and "Subject" 
* renaming the columns of the combined data
6. From the combined data, extract columns of interest, defined as any column with the strings "mean" or "std" in the name.
7. Transform the names of the columns of interest to "meaningful" names using further text processing as follows:
* changing capitalisation to "CamelCase" to make reading the variable names easier
* capitalising ordinate names (x to X, y to Y, Z to Z) to make reading easier
8. Grouping the data by activity, then subject, then taking the means of the grouped data
9. Saving the data to a file, "tidydata.txt"

#Optional code
This section of the *run_analysis.R* file shows
* how to read in the new, tidy dataset.
* how to compare the saved data with the tidy dataset generated by the *run_analysis.R* script.
